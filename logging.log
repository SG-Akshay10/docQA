and Founta et al. datasets. Evaluated traditional machine learning algorithms like SVM and XGBoost, as well as deep learning models like BERT + MLP, BERT + Bi-LSTM, and variants such as ALBERT, RoBERTa, and ELECTRA-BERT. Achieved top performance with BERT+MLP model (F1 scores: 0.91 and 0.79). SharpEye | Python, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, OpenCV,Pytorch Link to Demo Conducted an ablation study to compare simple image processing techniques with deep learning models for number plate recognition. Utilized image processing techniques such as bilateral filtering, canny edge detection, and contour detection to identify and segment characters on number plates. Deployed a CNN model trained on Alphabet and MNIST datasets to recognize characters from segmented images. Employed YOLO model for deep learning-based detection and segmentation of number plates, followed by EasyOCR for character recognition. Achieved 95% accuracy with deep learning techniques, outperforming 78% with traditional image processing methods.
